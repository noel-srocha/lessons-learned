# Project Lessons Learned

This project was developed originally using only HTML5 and CSS3 as evaluative step in advancing at Trybe's Web Development Course. With enough knowledge on React, I was able to rebuild the project with said library and generate a better result than it was before.

## Technologies Used:

1. JavaScript;
2. Stateless React.
